# Teams App Localization
This sample illustrates how to implement localization for Teams App.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/msft-teams/tools.git
    ```

1) If you are using Visual Studio
  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `Localization` folder
  - Select `Localization.csproj` file

1) Run ngrok - point to port 44374

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 44374
    ```
### Globalization and Localization


1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `Manifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

1) Run your app, either from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder.

## Interacting with the app in Teams

In Teams, Once the app is succefully installed, it can be opened and the tab should show the logged in user's profile.
